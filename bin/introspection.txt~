Initial Ideas:
We decided to program the game "Battleship" in python for this project.
We chose to do this because the game would require little graphics work
and had a predetermined and contained structure. There was a clear
winning state and a limited number of decisions, which minimized the
number of cases we had to account for in our code.
We used python to write the code because of previous experience with 
the language
